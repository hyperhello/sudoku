# sudoku
Quick HTML5 Sudoku solver. It uses a standard recursive technique to brute force the possible answers to a puzzle, and will generate sample puzzles for you to solve. This was written while I was wondering whether it was always possible to come to a conclusion about whether a puzzle was solvable.
